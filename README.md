# Terraform-managed Azure Service Connection

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/geekzter/Pipeline%20Playground/_apis/build/status%2Fcreate-service-connection?branchName=main&label=terraform-ci)](https://dev.azure.com/geekzter/Pipeline%20Playground/_build/latest?definitionId=14&branchName=main)

Azure DevOps uses service connections to access services that are targets for cloud infrastructure provisioning and application deployment. The most commonly used service connection is the [Azure Resource Manager service connection](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/library/connect-to-azure?view=azure-devops). By default, this creates an object in Azure DevOps, an identity in Entra ID and a role assignment in Azure.

Many Enterprise customers have requirements around the management of Entra [workload identities](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/workload-id/workload-identities-overview) (applications, service principals, managed identities) as well as the permissions identities are granted.

Here are a few common requirements and constraints:

- Creation of app registrations is [restricted in the Entra ID tenant](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/delegate-app-roles#restrict-who-can-create-applications) and/or
the use of Managed Identities for Azure access is mandated
- Specific secret expiration and auto-rotation control
- ITSM metadata is required on Entra ID objects (service management reference, naming convention, notes)
- Co-owners are required to exist on Entra ID apps
- Access is managed through Entra ID group membership, access control lists should not include individual principals
- Custom role assignments are needed for Azure [data plane](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/control-plane-and-data-plane#data-plane) access e.g. [Key Vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/general/rbac-guide?tabs=azure-cli#azure-built-in-roles-for-key-vault-data-plane-operations), [Kusto](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/data-explorer/kusto/access-control/role-based-access-control), [Storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/assign-azure-role-data-access?tabs=portal)
- Access needs to be granted to multiple Azure subscriptions that are not part of the same management group
- An IT fulfillment process exists where identities are automatically provisioned based on a service request

## Why Terraform?

Terraform employs a plugable provider model which enables all changes to be made by a single tool and configuration:

| Service      | Provider | API |
|--------------|----------|-----|
| Azure        | [azurerm](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs)     | [Azure Resource Manager REST API](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/resources/) |
| Azure DevOps | [azuredevops](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/microsoft/azuredevops/latest/docs) | [Azure DevOps REST API](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/azure/devops/serviceendpoint/endpoints) |
| Entra ID     | [azuread](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azuread/latest/docs)     | [Microsoft Graph API](https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/use-the-api) |

[HCL](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language#about-the-terraform-language), the language used, is declarative and the tool is capable if inferring dependencies to create resources in order. For the most part, dependencies do not have to be declared explicitly. This is the output generated by `terraform graph`:

More information:

- [Overview of Terraform on Azure - What is Terraform?](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/terraform/overview)
- [Cloud Adoption Framework - Infrastructure-as-Code CI/CD security guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/secure/best-practices/secure-devops)

## Provisioning

Provisioning is a matter of specifying Terraform [variables](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/variables) (see [inputs](#inputs) below) and running `terraform apply`. To set variables, you can create a .auto.tfvars file, see [sample](config.auto.tfvars.sample).
To understand how the Terraform configuration can be created in automation, review
[deploy.ps1](scripts/deploy.ps1) and the
[CI pipeline](azure-pipelines.yml).  

### Examples

Below are common configurations. You can mix & match these to meet specific requirements.

#### Default configuration

![](visuals/app-fic.png)

This creates an App registration with Federated Identity Credential and `Contributor` role on the Azure subscription used by the Terraform `azurerm` provider.

```hcl
azdo_organization_url          = "https://dev.azure.com/my-organization"
azdo_project_name              = "my-project"
```

Pre-requisites:

- The user can create app registrations i.e.:
  - Creation of app registrations is not [disabled in Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/delegate-app-roles#restrict-who-can-create-applications);
  or
  - The user is member of a privileged Entra ID role e.g. [Application Developer](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#application-developer)
- The user is an owner of the Azure subscription (so role assignment can be performed)

#### Managed Identity with FIC and custom RBAC

![](visuals/msi-fic-multi-rbac.png)

This creates a Managed Identity with Federated Identity Credential and custom Azure RBAC (role-based access control) role assignments:

```hcl
azdo_organization_url          = "https://dev.azure.com/my-organization"
azdo_project_name              = "my-project"
azure_role_assignments         = [
    {
        scope                  = "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
        role                   = "Contributor"
    },
    {
        scope                  = "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/rg"
        role                   = "Storage Blob Data Contributor"
    },
    {
        scope                  = "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/rg"
        role                   = "Key Vault Secrets User"
    }
]
create_federation              = true
create_managed_identity        = true
managed_identity_resource_group_id = "/subscriptions/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111/resourceGroups/msi-rg"
```

Pre-requisites:

- A resource group to hold the Managed Identity has been pre-created
- The user is an owner of the Azure scopes to create role assignments on

#### Managed Identity assigned to Entra ID security group

![](visuals/msi-fic-group.png)

This creates a Managed Identity with Federated Identity Credential and custom Azure RBAC (role-based access control) role assignments:

```hcl
azdo_organization_url          = "https://dev.azure.com/my-organization"
azdo_project_name              = "my-project"
azure_role_assignments         = [] # No direct assignments
create_federation              = true
create_managed_identity        = true
entra_security_group_names     = ["my-security-group"]
managed_identity_resource_group_id = "/subscriptions/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111/resourceGroups/msi-rg"
```

Pre-requisites:

- A resource group to hold the Managed Identity has been pre-created
- The user is an owner of the Entra ID security group to add the Managed Identity to

#### App registration with FIC and ITSM metadata

![](visuals/app-fic.png)

This creates an Entra ID app registration with IT service reference and notes fields populated as well as specifying co-owners:

```hcl
azdo_organization_url          = "https://dev.azure.com/my-organization"
azdo_project_name              = "my-project"
create_federation              = true
create_managed_identity        = false
entra_app_notes                = "Service connection for business application ABC deployment to XYZ environment"
entra_app_owner_object_ids     = ["00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111"]
entra_service_management_reference = "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111"
```

Pre-requisites:

- The user can create app registrations i.e.:
  - Creation of app registrations is not [disabled in Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/delegate-app-roles#restrict-who-can-create-applications);
  or
  - The user is member of a privileged Entra ID role e.g. [Application Developer](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#application-developer)
- The user is an owner of the Azure subscription (so role assignment can be performed)

#### App registration with short-lived secret and constrained access

![](visuals/app-secret-reader.png)

This creates an Entra ID app registration with secret that expires after 1 hour:

```hcl
azdo_organization_url          = "https://dev.azure.com/my-organization"
azdo_project_name              = "my-project"
azure_role_assignments         = [
    {
        scope                  = "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/rg"
        role                   = "Reader"
    }
]
create_federation              = false
create_managed_identity        = false
entra_secret_expiration_days   = 0 # secret lasts 1 hour
```

Pre-requisites:

- The user can create app registrations i.e.:
  - Creation of app registrations is not [disabled in Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/delegate-app-roles#restrict-who-can-create-applications);
